# Remaining-work ledger

Review baseline: c46415282a2a796cf737a9c3b7f7ba941f19bf7b (2026-09-13).
**Release HOLD. Implementation continues; unresolved live gates remain VERIFY.**
Execution authority: [implementation plan](IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md).
Previous completion notes: [archived ledger](STATUS_ARCHIVE_20260913.md).

Second review at c6230b1 found no intervening implementation changes. Queue status
is unchanged. F11–F14 refine N01/N02/N03/N09/N11/N12: current operational guidance,
removal of obsolete test/API contracts, bounded audit queries and editor-to-publisher
draft handoff. B05/B13/B15/B16/B19 specify their exact expected outcomes.

## Queue

Only N packets are active. Completed parts of X00–X23 were removed through the
[reconciliation](IMPLEMENTATION_REVIEW.md); do not repeat that implementation.
All N packets below contain remaining changes or qualification, not claims that
their underlying functionality is wholly absent.

- N01 — Baseline/toolchain: READY; B01/B02.
- N02 — Contracts/deletion: OPEN; requires N01; B03/G01–G04.
- N03 — Pairing/mutation contracts: OPEN; requires N02; B04/B05.
- N04 — Secret/IO/resource enforcement: OPEN; requires N02/N03; B06.
- N05 — Identity/normal authentication: OPEN; requires N03; B07/B08.
- N06 — Design foundation/shell: OPEN; requires N01; B09.
- N07 — Async UI/recovery: OPEN; requires N03/N05/N06; B10.
- N08 — Asset/policy authoring: OPEN; requires N03/N06/N07; B11/B12.
- N09 — Review/publication/history: OPEN; requires N07/N08; B13.
- N10 — Connection/plugin lifecycle: OPEN; requires N03/N04/N06/N07; B14.
- N11 — Access/settings/audit/consumers: OPEN; requires N05/N07/N09/N10; B15.
- N12 — Two-process transactional qualification: OPEN; requires N03/N04/N05; B16.
- N13 — Independent packages/live consumers: OPEN; requires N02/N03/N04/N05/N12; B17.
- N14 — Lean tests/capacity: OPEN; requires N01/N07/N08/N10/N12/N13; B18/B19.
- N15 — Deployment/recovery/artifact integrity: OPEN; requires N05/N12/N13/N14; B20/B21.
- N16 — Independent security/UX acceptance: OPEN; requires N01–N15; B22/all G/B.

READY means all prerequisites pass. OPEN means remaining work with prerequisites
not yet complete. ACTIVE means an agent owns a bounded slice. VERIFY means code
exists but required execution or human evidence is missing. DONE requires every
FR/NFR and acceptance subcase to pass on the candidate. Missing access/environment
is recorded explicitly; it is never PASS or a waived skip.

## Evidence inherited, with limits

The historical ledger reports Python/socket-enabled suite and PostgreSQL checks
and a local Python/DuckDB probe. This review did not rerun them. Repository-level
race tests do not establish two-process API races; stub consumer reads and pair
descriptors do not qualify live catalogs; backup helper tests do not establish
timed restore. See F08/F09 and N12/N13/N15. Reuse the existing harnesses.

## Implementation update — c1b4866 (2026-09-13)

- Packet / status / candidate commit / owner: N11 partial / VERIFY / `c1b4866` / control-plane + UI.
- Observable behavior delivered: `/v1/audit/events/page` provides bounded keyset pagination ordered by `(created_at, id)`; non-admin visibility is enforced with database `EXISTS` predicates and asset-specific reads still require the read capability. The existing list endpoint now uses the same scoped query. Activity loads 50 events and can request later pages without an unbounded fetch.
- Changed paths: audit application/repository/service, policy routes, UI API/activity view, ORM and migration `20260913_0016_audit_keyset_index.py`. No pickle serializer, payload class, or import path changed.
- Primary tests: `tests/interfaces/control_plane/test_audit_api.py`, `tests/architecture/test_control_plane_route_inventory.py`, `tests/common/config_store/test_schema_migrations.py`.
- Evidence: `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/dal-obscura-uv-cache uv run --no-sync pytest tests/interfaces/control_plane/test_audit_api.py tests/architecture/test_control_plane_route_inventory.py tests/common/config_store -q` — 20 passed. `pnpm --dir apps/governance-ui check` — passed. `ruff check` on changed Python paths — passed. UI production build is VERIFY because local Corepack could not fetch pinned `pnpm@12.3.4` from the npm registry.
- Remaining N11/B15 work: filter/pagination controls in the activity UI, complete actor/resource/time/outcome/request-ID filters, full permission matrix, settings/access/consumer qualification, and independent security/UX evidence.

## Implementation update — 018929a (2026-09-13)

- Packet / status / candidate commit / owner: N11 partial / VERIFY / `018929a` / control-plane.
- Observable behavior delivered: the audit page accepts bounded actor, action, resource type, outcome, correlation/request ID, and inclusive time-window filters. Filters are applied in SQL before the stable keyset limit, with text lengths enforced at the HTTP boundary.
- Primary test: `tests/interfaces/control_plane/test_audit_api.py::test_audit_page_filters_before_pagination` covers compound filtering, actor filtering, and overlong input rejection.
- Evidence: `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/dal-obscura-uv-cache uv run --no-sync pytest tests/interfaces/control_plane/test_audit_api.py tests/architecture/test_control_plane_route_inventory.py -q` — 5 passed; changed Python `ruff check` — passed.
- Remaining N11/B15 work: activity filter controls still need UI wiring and the complete permission/settings/consumer qualification remains open.

## Implementation update — e4764f5 (2026-09-13)

- Packet / status / candidate commit / owner: N11 partial / VERIFY / `e4764f5` / governance UI.
- Observable behavior delivered: Activity now exposes actor, action, request ID, resource type, outcome, and time-window filters. Applying or clearing filters reloads the server-scoped keyset query; loading more retains the same filter set.
- Evidence: `apps/governance-ui/node_modules/.bin/tsc -p apps/governance-ui/tsconfig.json` — passed. The pnpm wrapper remains environment-blocked while resolving the pinned package manager from the npm registry.
- Remaining N11/B15 work: full permission matrix, settings and consumer handoff qualification, production browser evidence, and independent UX/security review.

Regression evidence after the N11 slices: `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/dal-obscura-uv-cache uv run --no-sync pytest tests/control_plane tests/interfaces/control_plane tests/common/config_store -q` — all collected tests passed (100%); no skips were introduced.

Direct UI production verification also passed: `apps/governance-ui/node_modules/.bin/tsc -p apps/governance-ui/tsconfig.json && apps/governance-ui/node_modules/.bin/vite build` produced the Vite bundle (260.29 kB JavaScript, 14.22 kB CSS). The package-manager wrapper remains blocked only when it attempts to fetch its pinned Corepack metadata.

## Per-packet record template

Replace the corresponding queue entry and keep one current record per packet.
Link detailed logs/artifacts instead of appending repeated full narratives.

- Packet / status / candidate commit / owner:
- Observable behavior delivered; FR/NFR and B/G subcases:
- Changed and deleted paths; old callers removed; protected pickle check:
- Production/test logical SLOC delta; dependencies added/removed and reason:
- Primary invariant test owners; tests consolidated/deleted:
- Exact commands, exit codes, UTC date, runtime versions, environment:
- Artifact and fixture hashes; evidence locations:
- Remaining subcases; blocker and next concrete action:
- Atomic implementation commits:
- Human acceptance, if required: reviewer/date/artifact or VERIFY:

Do not mark N16 complete on build/lint success or substitute agent self-review
for independent review. Until candidate-bound gates all pass, release is HOLD.
